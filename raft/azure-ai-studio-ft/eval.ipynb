    "# Evaluation with Data\n",
    "In this notebook, we introduce built-in evaluators and guide you through creating your own custom evaluators. We'll cover both code-based and prompt-based custom evaluators. Finally, we'll demonstrate how to use the `evaluate` API to assess data using these evaluators.\n"
